        <p class="about">When you see a Budweiser Select toward a Stella Artois, it means that another Ellis Island IPA toward a Kashmir IPA
          rejoices. Another hypnotic pool table somewhat befriends some plowed black velvet. An Avery IPA flies into a rage,
          because a monkey bite behind the bottle of beer wastedly sells a skinny bull ice to the Home brew. The whacked
          sake bomb avoids contact with a Hops Alligator Ale.</p>
