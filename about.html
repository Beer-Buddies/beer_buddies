        <p class="about">Keeley is a budding Full Stack Javascript developer living in Portland, OR. Originally an audio engineer
          by training, she's spent the last seven years working in advertising, practicing small Python programs on nights
          and weekeneds. She's excited to start a career as a developer, and bring her background in marketing and design
          to the code base. She also loves baking and running in the woods.</p>

        <p class="about">Morgan is new to Portland, and new to programming. Her first career was as a modern and ballet dancer, and she looks
          forward to exploring the connections between web development and choreography. Morgan is very excited for the opportunity
          to be a part of such a powerful community. She plans to channel the knowledge that she gains toward empowering

        <h3 class="about">Grayson</h3>
        <p class="about">Grayson is a former music industry worker, turned programming ramblin' man. His plans are to one day combine knowlegde
          of both industries. Wealthy, attractive, intelligent, tall, really fast running, cool guy, and like really strong,
          are only a few ways to describe this "nice Jewish boy" your grandmother (or friend's grandmother) always said you
          should date. With the help of coding bootcamps and internet coding classes, you know he'll be an A+ coder soon,
          as well. "No need for an interview, I've got the job?" Figured.</p>

        <h3 class="about">Jade</h3>
        <p class="about">Jade is a feral web coder who has recently migrated to Portland in search of opportunity. Hissy, but secretly likes
          pets. Interested in how technology overtly and subversively shapes society and in active pursuit of a bewildering
          21st century zeitgeist. In other words, interested in technology for more than its own sake, to personal and societal
          ends. Intrigued by singularitarian and feminist ideas. Also, they're like, really enamored with robots and other
          post-human life for some reason!</p>
