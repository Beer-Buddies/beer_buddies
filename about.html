        <h3 class="about">Keeley</h3>
        <p class="about">Keeley is a developing (oh ho ho) Full Stack Javascript developer living in Portland, OR. Originally an audio engineer 
          by training, she's spent the last seven years working in advertising, practicing small Python programs on nights and weekeneds. She's excited
          to start a career as a developer, and bring her background in marketing and design to the code base.</p>

        <h3 class="about">Morgan</h3>
        <p class="about">Morgan is new to Portland, and new to programming. Her first career was as a modern and ballet dancer, 
          and she looks forward to exploring the connections between web development and choreography. Morgan is very excited 
          for the opportunity to be a part of such a powerful community. She plans to channel the knowledge that she gains 
          toward empowering others of marginalized communities.</p>

        <h3 class="about">Grayson</h3>
        <p class="about">Grayson is a former music industry worker, turned programming ramblin' man. His plans are to one day combine knowlegde of both industries. Wealthy, attractive, intelligent, tall, really fast running, cool guy, and like really strong, are only a few ways to describe this "nice Jewish boy" your grandmother (or friend's grandmother) always said you should date. With the help of coding bootcamps and internet coding classes, you know he'll be an A+ coder soon, as well. "No need for an interview, I've got the job?" Figured.</p>

        <h3 class="about">Jade</h3>
        <p class="about">When you see a Budweiser Select toward a Stella Artois, it means that another Ellis Island IPA toward a Kashmir IPA
          rejoices. Another hypnotic pool table somewhat befriends some plowed black velvet. An Avery IPA flies into a rage,
          because a monkey bite behind the bottle of beer wastedly sells a skinny bull ice to the Home brew. The whacked
          sake bomb avoids contact with a Hops Alligator Ale.</p>
