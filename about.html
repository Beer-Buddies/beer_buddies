        <p>When you see a Budweiser Select toward a Stella Artois, it means that another Ellis Island IPA toward a Kashmir IPA rejoices.

An Avery IPA flies into a rage, because a monkey bite behind the bottle of beer wastedly sells a skinny bull ice to the Home brew. The whacked sake bomb avoids contact with a Hops Alligator Ale.</p>
