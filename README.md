# Beer Repo: Final Project for Code 201

## Team Name: Undefined

## Members:
- Morgan Fogarty
- Grayson Meindl
- Keeley Hammond
- Jade Rager

## Pitch:
We’re developing a trivia game, for one-to-four players.

## MVP: 
- A trivia game that allows users to answer five questions and returns their score. 
- There will be three HTML pages: index, play and about.
- “index.html” allows the user to create an account and choose a beer avatar
- “play.html” takes the user to the trivia game
- “about.html” is where the user is taken to show their scores - this page displays high scores, and the bios of the game creators.
- The score of each user will be displayed under their name during each round.
- The scores of each user will be stored in localStorage.

## Additional Features:
- Timed Lightning Rounds: Randomize the photo shown per lightning round
- Animated beer icons for your score display: increment the beer level with each score.
- Allow users to select their own names and drink avatars
- Add 3-4 categories of questions for the trivia
- Randomized questions (from a selection of many questions per category)
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Saved game sessions
- Multiple drink types to choose from (for non-alcoholic friends)
- Appealing styling and animation in the CSS
